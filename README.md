# MemoryGame
Single-page web application with REST API backend

Memory-Game, is a simple game consisting of a deck of card pairs. The cards are placed face-down on the table, and the player inspects the card values, two at a time, looking for matches. After each turn the cards are again placed face-down, unless a matching pair is found, in which case those two cards are cleared from the game. The game objective is to find all card pairs in the fewest amount of turns.
